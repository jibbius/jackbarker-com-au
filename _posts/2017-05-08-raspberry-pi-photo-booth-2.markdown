## Overview of Part 2
Before providing a full set of components and plans for the Photo Booth, I'd recommend breadboarding out a simple version to get you started.

If you want to skip that step, then feel free to jump ahead.


## Getting Started with Pi and PiCamera
To start breadboarding out the photo booth, you will need:
 - A Raspberry Pi
   - I am version 3 of the Raspberry Pi
   - I have also tested my code against Pi version 2B (also works fine)
 - An SD card
   - I am using a 16Gb card, although smaller cards will probably be fine.
 - A Pi Camera
   - I am using PiCamera version 2
   - The earlier version of the camera will also be fine (although fewer megapixels)
 - An LCD screen, such as: the XPT2046<br>To power the screen, you will also need:
   - a spare USB phone charger, and
   - a spare micro USB cable
 - Jumper wires
   - Get a mix of M-M, M-F, and F-F
 - A momentary push button
   - Later on in the project, we will use a large arcade button w/ LED
   - If you don't have this right now, then you can proceed with a simple momentary switch button, or by just connecting and disconnecting a wire within the circuit
 - A breadboard
 - A keyboard you can borrow, and connect up to the Pi.
 - **Optional materials**:
   - A raspberry Pi breakout breadboard<br>(you will see that I was using this in a couple of the images below. I should note that for this project, it's overkill and not required)


## Preparing your Pi

### Installing the Operating System
For prototyping, I am running:
 - [The NOOBs version of Raspian][noobs]{:target="_blank"}

If this is new to you, there are plenty of [online tutorials][pi-software-guide]{:target="_blank"} that will help you in completing this step. For this reason I won't bother detailing it further here.

The NOOBs install of Raspian (**not Raspian Lite**) is by far the easiest method for doing this.

#### Alternatives
Using Raspian, the boot time for the Photo Booth is roughly <strong>40 seconds</strong>, and (for me) I was content enough with this duration that I haven't looked too far into alternatives at this stage.

If you want the booth to boot faster, then you may want to look at running a more light-weight OS. This is not a topic that I intend to cover right now, but I may cover this later after testing a few different options out.

### Raspberry Pi Configuration
If you haven't already done so, make sure you've got a keyboard and mouse plugged in to your Pi, and that the Pi is hooked up to a screen (which can even be the photo booth's LCD screen if you like).

We are going need to change a number of configuration options, in order to get the most out of out Pi.

You can do this via the Raspbian application menu, selecting: `Preferences` > `Raspberry Pi Configuration`.

Alternatively, you can access a similar set of options via the command line (using `sudo raspi-config`).

- Within **System**;
  - Make sure you click `Change password`
  <br>(Even though "it's only a Pi", it's **never** a good idea to keep using the default password `raspberry`).

    img="/2017/photo_booth/part2-pi_config_system"
    ext=".png"
    alt="Raspberry Pi Config: System"
    class="medium"
%}

- Within **Interfaces**;
  - You must enable 'Camera'.
  - Other useful options to enable here are:
    - 'VNC', which lets you remotely connect to the Pi from another computer (after downloading the **RealVNC Viewer** _client_ application, onto another computer).
    - 'SSH', which allows you to connect remotely to the pi via an SSH terminal. This is an option for advanced users, and not required for this tutorial.

{% include image-2.html
    img="/2017/photo_booth/part2-pi_config_interfaces"
    ext=".png"
    alt="Raspberry Pi Config: Interfaces"
    class="medium"
%}

- Within **Localisation**;
  - By default, your Pi is probably configured to use a UK **Keyboard**.
  - If your keyboard doesn't have a pound key (Â£) on it, then you probably need to switch to a US keyboard (or whichever keyboard is appropriate to you).
  - It's also worth changing your **Locale**, **Timezone**, and **WiFi country** while here.

    img="/2017/photo_booth/part2-pi_config_localisation"
    ext=".png"
    alt="Raspberry Pi Config: Localisation"
    class="medium"
%}

Click `OK`, to save.

After saving all of these options, you should restart the Pi to ensure that the changes take effect.

### Connecting to WiFi
If you haven't already done so, you'll now want to connect your Pi to WiFi.

If you are using Raspbian this is relatively straightforward (just click the wireless networking logo in the top right of the screen, and setup the network).

Once you've connected up to WiFi, it is also possible to connect to the Pi from another computer via VNC or `SSH`. We'll get to this step later on.

### Connecting the LCD Screen
If you haven't already done so, connect the Pi to the LCD screen that we will be using as the screen for the Photo Booth.

My screen connected to the Pi via an HDMI cable.

The screen also requires a separate power source (until I get around to tidying that up). The easiest way to do this is a via a spare USB phone charger and micro-USB cable.

When I first connected the screen, the display settings weren't 100% correct, but we can fix that now.

Open up the **Terminal**, we are going to enter the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
#Note: You will be prompted to enter your password
{% endhighlight %}

We can then edit the config file, and we'll need to add the following lines of code to the end of the file;

    hdmi_force_hotplug=1
    start_x=1
    disable_camera_led=1
    gpu_mem=128
    hdmi_group=2
    hdmi_mode=87
    hdmi_cvt=800 480 60 6 0 0 0

The impact of these changes is as follows;
 - **hdmi_force_hotplug=1**
   - This forces the Pi to use HDMI mode, even if an HDMI cable is not detected.
 - **start_x=1**
   - This enables the camera module.
 - **disable_camera_led=1**
   - This disables the camera LED, which usually comes on when the camera is in use.
 - **gpu_mem=128**
   - This allocates us some memory to use the camera.
 - **hdmi_group=2**
   - This allows us to use DMT display formats.
 - **hdmi_mode=87**
   - This allows us to specify custom display settings.
 - **hdmi_cvt=800 480 60 6 0 0 0**
   - These are the display settings for our screen: (i.e. 800x480 pixels, 60Hz, 15:9 ratio, no margins, progressive interlace, normal)

These changes will also require us to reboot the Pi.

If you've made a mistake whilst changing any of these settings, you can boot the Pi in recovery mode (hold the right `SHIFT` key), and then edit the config file (`e`).

### Connecting the Camera
If you've gone with a PiCamera per my recommendation then installation is straight-forward (although perhaps a bit fiddly). The camera will connect to your Pi via a Ribbon Connector.

I'd recommend looking up a YouTube video for how to connect your Pi to the camera. It is different for each version of the Pi, and the latch mechanisms can be a bit fragile if forced in the wrong manner.

## A Test Run of the Camera
### Connecting to the Pi from another computer
Because we will be using the LCD screen to display the camera's output, and we still want to be able to enter commands at the same time, it is best to connect to the Pi from another computer (using `VNC Viewer` or `SSH`).

The easier option for beginners is using the VNC Viewer. There are instructions to help you do this, [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/vnc/){:target="_blank"}.

Once we are connected to the Pi remotely, we can familiarise ourselves with the PyCamera library.

Begin by opening `Terminal` or `UXTerm` on the Pi.
You will be greeted with a command prompt.

From here, we can access the python interpreter by typing `python`.

### Camera test via Python interpreter
Within the interpreter, enter the following commands:

{% highlight python %}
import picamera
camera = picamera.PiCamera()
camera.start_preview()
{% endhighlight %}

The camera will now be displaying your picture on the screen that is connected to the Pi.

(Note, if you ignored my suggestion to connect to the Pi from another computer, you can close the app by typing `ctrl` + `\`).

### Flip and Rotate the camera

You may need to flip and/or rotate the picture, such that it suits the angle your camera has been mounted at.

{% highlight python %}
camera.hflip = True
camera.rotation = 90
{% endhighlight %}

### Save a photo

Enter a couple more commands into the terminal, to save a photo:

{% highlight python %}
filename = '~\my_test_photo.jpg'
camera.capture(filename)
{% endhighlight %}

Exit the python interpreter:

{% highlight python %}
exit()
{% endhighlight %}

You can now see that the photo has been saved to the Pi.

{% highlight bash %}
ls ~
{% endhighlight %}

## Connecting up the button
Now that we have a basic understanding of how our PiCamera will work, it is time to connect our button.

Shutdown the Pi:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo shutdown now
{% endhighlight %}

Disconnect the power supply.

The button needs to connect to **GPIO21** and **Ground**.

Once the button is attached we can safely boot up the Pi again.

Connect your button to the Pi, as follows:

{% include image-2.html
    img="/2017/photo_booth/part2_photo_booth_camera_test_circuit"
    ext=".png"
    alt="wiring diagram"
    caption="Photo booth: Wiring diagram."
    class="more-padding large"
%}

## Running a "Test app"
Once the button is connected we can run a simplified version of our photo booth code.

This piece of code doesn't have the full functionality of my finished photo booth, but it contains "just enough" to test out the functionality that we care about and get an idea of how the finished code might look.

The code we are going to run is shown here:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jibbius/8105081adfc0d6dd7da77cd813c69593.js"></script>

Boot up your Raspberry Pi again.

You can then either;
 - Copy the code into a text file (`simple-photo-booth.py`) manually, or
 - Enter the following at the command line on the Pi to download it:

{% highlight bash %}
mkdir ~/simple-photo-booth
git clone https://gist.github.com/8105081adfc0d6dd7da77cd813c69593.git ~/simple-photo-booth
{% endhighlight %}

Run the code via:

{% highlight bash %}
cd ~/simple-photo-booth
python simple-photo-booth.py
{% endhighlight %}

Press the button to test the code.

{% include image-2.html
    img="/2017/photo_booth/1_Breadboarding_2"
    alt="Testing the photo booth components"
    caption="Testing the photo booth components"
    class="large"
%}

To exit the **simple photo booth** app, press `ctrl` + `c`.

## Next article
For the [next article]({{ "/photo-booth/3" | prepend: site.url }}) in this series, I'll be talking about <strong>building the wood cabinet</strong> that houses the photo booth.


If you'd prefer to skip that step, you can jump ahead to [Part 5]({{ "/photo-booth/5" | prepend: site.url }}), where we extend our "simple photo booth" code into a **Fully-featured Photo Booth app**.
