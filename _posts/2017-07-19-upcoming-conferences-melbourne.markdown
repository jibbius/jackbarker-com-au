## The line-up
I am super excited to see the following in my calendar this month;

<div class="row">
<div class="column center-text" markdown="1">

### GovHack 2017
#### Australia-wide
##### July 28th to 30th

{% include image-2.html img="/2017/govhack_logo" ext=".png" alt="GovHack Logo" class="medium no-border" %}

</div><!-- end: column -->
<div class="column center-text" markdown="1">

### PyCon Australia 2017
#### Melbourne
##### August 3rd to 8th

{% include image-2.html img="/2017/pycon_logo" ext=".png" alt="PyCon AU logo" class="medium no-border" %}

</div><!-- end: column -->
</div><!-- end: row -->

<div class="row">
<div class="column center-text" markdown="1">

**GovHack** is _the_ Hackathon, for getting involved in government technology initiatives, and promoting Open Data.

I'll be hanging out at the Ballarat outpost of the event, and am excited to see what we can come up with.

</div><!-- end: column -->
<div class="column center-text" markdown="1">

**PyCon AU** returns to Melbourne in 2017, for a week long homage to the Python Programming language. The two main event days are the Saturday and Sunday, but it looks to be a killer schedule all round.

## Are you coming too?
Tickets are still available, but you don't have much time left.

But, if you can't make it, all is not lost; I fully expect that the PyCon talks will be recorded and eventually published online (as they were last year).

I'll also be writing up my summary of the events.

Hope to see some of you folks there!
