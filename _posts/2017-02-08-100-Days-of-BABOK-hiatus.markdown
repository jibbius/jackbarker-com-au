**Phew**, studying and blogging **daily** is kinda hard!

For anyone out there reading this, you may have noticed I just took a week off.

In addition to everything else I've been working on, I moved cities last weekend.
I also used the opportunity to take some time out, and reassess what I'm looking to do with my writing.


## New Objectives

I want these posts to provide engaging content; and not just a "rehash of the BABOK".

I've already had some thoughts as to how I'll go about this.
I intend to post some content **new content** in this **new format**, very soon.


If you have suggestions, feel free to drop us comment, tweet, or email.

( Would be great to find out whether anyone's read this! :smile: )
