Yesterday, I attended the **IIBA's Business Analysis Professional Day** in Melbourne.

The day had some excellent talks and workshops, all of which left me with plenty to muse upon after the event.

## Rita Panahi - Good Thinking (Keynote)
Rita provided a fantastic introduction to the event. As a journalist and opinion columnist, she underscored the need to thoroughly investigate data as opposed to "taking the simple path".

This is a point that she unappolegitically illustrated, drawing parallels to her own coverage of politically-delicate issues:

- The [occupation of homes by "squatters"][1] amidst the fallout of Melbourne's Eastwest Link; and the resultant impact upon domestic abuse victims awaiting state housing.
- Hyperinflation of the narative surrounding the [Gender pay gap][2], due to improper scrutiny of data.
- The trend within universities with relation to [trigger-warning policies][3] and social-justice activism, and its effects upon free speech and education. 

Within each of these stories existed a subtext, which required an analytical scrutiny beyond the initial dataset.

The idea 

## Taruni Falconer - Communicating With Stakeholders (Workshop)

- Communicating With Stakeholders
- Making Cross-Cultural Communication Work For You

## Craig Martin - A journey through business design using hybrid thinking (Workshop)

- 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th order design.

## Sonia McDonald - Leadership is an Attitude

The final talk of the day, posed the question "what is leadership?".

## Closing thoughts...
