Yesterday, I attended the IIBA's **Business Analysis Professional Day** in Melbourne. This is the largest IIBA event that I have attended.

The day had some excellent talks and workshops, which left me with plenty to muse upon after the event.

## Keynote address - Rita Panahi
Rita provided a fantastic introduction to the event. As a journalist and opinion columnist, she underscored the need to thoroughly investigate data as opposed to "taking the simple path".

This is a point that she unappolegitically illustrated, drawing parallels to her own coverage of politically-delicate issues:

* The **occupation of homes by "squatters"** amidst the fallout of Melbourne's Eastwest Link; and the resultant impact upon domestic abuse victims awaiting state housing.
* Hyperinflation of the narative surrounding the [Gender pay gap][1], due to improper scrutiny of data.
* The trend within universities with relation to **trigger-warning policies** and social-justice activism, and its effects upon free speech and education. 

Within each of these stories exists a subtext that requires an analytical scrutiny beyond the initial hypothesis, and a refusal to accept data without rigour.

This speech of course was pertinant to the BA profession, albeit with a degree of difference.
