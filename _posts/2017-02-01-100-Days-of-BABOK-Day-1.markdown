Well, it's been a busy January, but I finally convinced myself to take on the #100DaysOfBABOK challenge that I [committed to at the end of last year](/blog/100-Days-of-BABOK/).

Today, is Day 1.

## Today's Objectives

Today my goal is to commit to memory the initial frameworks established in Chapter 1, namely;

- The BA Knowledge Areas
- The BA Core Competency Model (BACCM)

And, ensuring I understand the following terms;

- Task (1.4.3)
- Underlying Competency (1.4.4)
- Technique (1.4.5)
- Perspective (1.4.6)

## Summary Notes

### BA Knowledge Areas
For me, it helped to picture these as a map (or environment) in my mind; and then "jumping" from area to area.

### Terms

The BABOK has its own definitions for the below.

Here is my simplified version;

<dl>

  <dt>Task</dt>
  <dd>A discrete piece of work that falls within the domain of Business Analysis (i.e. "Something a BA does").</dd>
  
  <dt>Underlying Competency</dt>
  <dd>Underlying knowledge and skills that are likely to assist the BA in a given task (i.e. "A BA's traits or skills").</dd>

  <dt>Technique</dt>
  <dd>A (recognised) way that the task *might* be completed. For example - **Stakeholder interviews** might be a technique for validating requirements.</dd>

  <dt>Perspective</dt>
  <dd>A project methodology (i.e. Agile / Waterfall), or other viewpoint, that might affect the technique/task.</dd>

</dl>


### BA Core Competency Model

Finally, my summary of the Core Competency Model:

<dl>

  <dt>Needs</dt>
  <dd>Problems (opportunities) that prompt a change/solution.</dd>

  <dt>Change</dt>
  <dd>An act of transformation, in response to a **need**.</dd>

  <dt>Solutions</dt>
  <dd>A specific method/approach for addressing a **need**.</dd>

  <dt>Stakeholders</dt>
  <dd>Individuals that are affected by the **need**, **change**, or **solution**.</dd>

  <dt>Value</dt>
  <dd>A measure of how valuable a **solution** option is, to a **stakeholder**.</dd>

  <dt>Contexts</dt>
  <dd>Variables / Conditions that must be considered with respect to a **change**.
    <br>The BABOK has a vast list of examples - including: culture, attitudes, governments,
    technology, weather.
  </dd>
  
</dl>

### Further thoughts on the BACCM

The BABOK describes the importance of the common vocabulary above, and that each concept is expected
to be equally relevant in any given business analysis effort.

I do not intend to reproduce all of that content here.

I think the key takeaways however, are:

* That the BACCM lets us consider how **complete** and **thorough** our analysis has been.
* The BACCM lets us share a common terminology with others in the profession.


## Reflections

The content above, whilst somewhat dry, seems to form a critical foundation for anyone taking the CBAP (or intending to digest the BABOK).

With the BA Knowledge areas now firmly lodged in my brain, I'm keen to progress further into BABOK chapter 2.

The BACCM terms feel as though they need a good mnemonic - although perhaps, through use, they will become 2nd nature soon enough?
