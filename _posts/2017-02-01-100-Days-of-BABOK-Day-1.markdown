Well, it's been a busy January, but I finally convinced myself to take on the #100DaysOfBABOK challenge that I committed to at the end of last year.

Today, is Day 1.

## Today's Objectives

Today my goal is to commit to memory the initial frameworks established in Chapter 1, namely;

- The BA Knowledge Areas
- The BA Core Competency Model (BACCM)

And, ensuring I understand the following terms;

- Task (1.4.3)
- Underlying Competency (1.4.4)
- Technique (1.4.5)
- Perspective (1.4.6)

## Summary Notes

### BA Knowledge Areas
For me, it helped to picture these as a map (or environment) in my mind; and then "jumping" from area to area.
