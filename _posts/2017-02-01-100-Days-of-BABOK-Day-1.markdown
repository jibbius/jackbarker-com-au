Well, it's been a busy January, but I finally convinced myself to take on the #100DaysOfBABOK challenge that I [committed to at the end of last year](/blog/100-Days-of-BABOK/).

Today, is Day 1.

## Today's Objectives

Today my goal is to commit to memory the initial frameworks established in Chapter 1, namely;

- The BA Knowledge Areas
- The BA Core Competency Model (BACCM)

And, ensuring I understand the following terms;

- Task (1.4.3)
- Underlying Competency (1.4.4)
- Technique (1.4.5)
- Perspective (1.4.6)

## Summary Notes

### BA Knowledge Areas
For me, it helped to picture these as a map (or environment) in my mind; and then "jumping" from area to area.

### Terms

The BABOK has its own definitiions for the below, however, here is my simplified version.

<dl>
  <dt>Task</dt>
  <dd>A discrete piece of work that falls within the domain of Business Analysis (i.e. "Something a BA does").</dd>
  
  <dt>Underlying Competency</dt>
  <dd>Underlying knowledge and skills that are likely to assist the BA in a given task (i.e. "A BA's traits or skills").</dd>

  <dt>Technique</dt>
  <dd>A (recognised) way that the task *might* be completed. For example - **Stakeholder interviews** might be a technique for validating requirements.</dd>

  <dt>Perspective</dt>
  <dd>A project methodology (i.e. Agile / Waterfall), or other viewpoint, that might affect the technique/task.</dd>
