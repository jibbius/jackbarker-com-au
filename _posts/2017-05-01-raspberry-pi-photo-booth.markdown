## Back story
Last weekend, I had an absolute blast at my wedding.

So too, apparently, did my guests - who absolutely loved taking shots with the photo booth!

## The code
The code for my photo booth is available here: 

[https://github.com/jibbius/rasberry_pi_photo_booth](https://github.com/jibbius/rasberry_pi_photo_booth){:target="_blank"}

## The build process
Here are the high level steps:
1. [Listing out the requirements]({{ "/photo-booth/1" | prepend: site.url }})
1. [Getting started with Pi and PiCamera]({{ "/photo-booth/2" | prepend: site.url }})
1. [Building the Booth]({{ "/photo-booth/3" | prepend: site.url }})
1. Adding the 12volt LED lights
1. The code
1. Fine-tuning
1. Photo day!
1. Post-production

I'll be writing articles for each of these steps in the coming days and weeks.


## Next article
For the [next article]({{ "/photo-booth/1" | prepend: site.url }}) in this series, I'll be talking about <strong>the requirements process</strong> that I went through when planning my photo booth.
