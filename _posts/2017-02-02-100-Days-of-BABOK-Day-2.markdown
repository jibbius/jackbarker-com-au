**Sigh**, well it's now Day 2... so let's see what BABOK has in store for me today! :smile:

## Today's Objectives

Progressing further into Chapter 2, there are...

**More "Key Terms" (2.2):**

- Business Analysis
- Business Analysis Information
- Design
- Enterprise
- -Organization- Organisation
- Plan
- Requirement

**Then, the "Requirements Classification Schema" (2.3):**

- Business requirements
- Stakeholder requirements
- Solution requirements
  - Functional requirements
  - Non-functional requirements ("Quality of service" requirements)
- Transition requirements

**And, finally:**
- Stakeholders (2.4)
  - These seemed self-explanatory, and not worth memorising.
- The distinction between **Requirements** and **Designs** (2.5)
