## Keynote (Rita):
Rita provided a fantastic introduction to the event. As a journalist an Opinion style writer, she underscored the need to thoroughly investigate data - rather then take the simple path.

This is a point that she unappolegitically illustrated, when drawing parallels with her own coverage of issues including:

* the occupation of homes by "squatters" amidst the fallout of Melbourne's eastwest link; and the resultant impact upon domestic abuse victims awaiting state housing
* hyperinflation of the narative surrounding the gender-pay-gap, due to improper scrutiny of data.
* the trend within universities with relation to "trigger warning" policies and social-justice activism, and its effects upon free speech and education. 

Within each of these stories exists a subtext that requires an analytical scrutiny beyond the initial hypothesis, and a refusal to accept data without rigour.

This speech of course was pertinant to the BA profession, albeit with a degree of difference.
